# NeuralNetworks23

Prepare a public repository with your code, which should be properly polished and documented. 
Inside the repository, add:

-A README file describing very briefly the method and the instructions to install everything that is needed to run the code.
One notebook containing:
-a description of the method you have implemented (up to 1-2 pages);
-a detailed example of how to use the method and the code (similar to our lab sessions);
-a summary of the main results you have obtained.
